# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Read This

When trying to connect remotely to your Heroku database on an open network such as a coffee shop, library, or even your University WiFi, it will be blocked. If you are experiencing a Heroku connection error, this could be why.

### Important

* **This assignment must be deployed.** Be sure to utilize the [MYSQL Heroku Deployment Guide](../../03-Supplemental/MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf) in order to deploy your assignment.

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).

### Commits

Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

  * We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

  * Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

  * When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.

* We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

### Submission on BCS

* **This assignment must be deployed.** * Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
